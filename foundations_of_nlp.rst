**How machines process and understand human language**

NLP gives the machines the ability to read, understand and derive meaning from human languages. Human conversation is very complex. Data generated from conversations, declarations or even tweets are examples of unstructured data. Unstructured data doesnâ€™t fit neatly into the traditional row and column structure of relational databases, and represent the vast majority of data available in the actual world. It is messy and hard to manipulate. To handle this problem, we have this field of AI.
